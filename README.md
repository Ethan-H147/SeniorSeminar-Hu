# SeniorSeminar-Hu

First I will count the seminars and divide them into popular and unpopular, and popular means they appeared in people's choices more than 32 times(someone is gonna be left out). Then, I will place everyone who picked unpopular seminars into these ones they picked. After assigning unpopular ones, I will leave the students that picked one or two popular seminars for later. Then, I will assign these "greedy" students who chose 3 or more popular seminars into their popular choices that are not fully occupied yet, if anyone cannot fit, the choices they can't enter will get randomly replaced by unpopular seminars with empty seats. Then the students I left aside earlier will go in.

2023/1/18 Encountered some issue with visual studio code today, spent most of the class trying to setup visual studio code on a Mac.

2023/1/22 Finished the basic structure of Student and Seminar class, successfully loaded every student and their choices, working on tallying the number picks of each seminar to determine the popularity.

2023/1/24 Finished loading the choices but encountered a glitch that won't correctly print student's choices as an arraylist.

2023/1/26 Fixed the glitch and loaded all the unpopular seminars into students' schedules.
