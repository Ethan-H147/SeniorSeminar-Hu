# SeniorSeminar-Hu

First I will count the seminars and divide them into popular and unpopular, and popular means they appeared in people's choices more than 32 times(someone is gonna be left out). Then, I will place everyone who picked unpopular seminars into these ones they picked. After assigning unpopular ones, I will pick out the students that picked one or two popular seminars and place them into their popular choices if possible. Then, I will finally assign these "greedy" students into their popular choices that are not fully occupied yet, if in these two processes anyone cannot fit, the choices they can't enter will get randomly replaced by unpopular seminars with empty seats.
